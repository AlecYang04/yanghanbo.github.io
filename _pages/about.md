Welcome to my homepage! I am currently a senior student at the [School of the Gifted Young](https://en.scgy.ustc.edu.cn/main.htm), [University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/). My major is Information and Computational Science (Computational Mathematics). My research interests is primarily in the field of statistics, including quantile regression, subgroup analysis and variable selection.

I am seeking for a PhD position starting in Fall 2025.
